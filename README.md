# VisualPerceptron
 
The VisualPerceptron is a project meant for visualization of the learning process of a Perceptron. It was originally designed to be used as an example of such algorithm in a class about Neural Networks.

The original implementation uses PyQT to provide a GUI, in which the user can tune some parameters, feed some data visually and watch the Perceptron learning (or not) how to classify the given data.

All the Perceptron algorithm is implemented using no library other than Numpy.

## How to

If you are on Windows 64bits, simply run the .exe inside de dist folder. If not, you should run the main.py file.
